**Odoo Pre-Internship Assignment
**
This repo is my solution for Odoo Pre-Internship Assignment using Odoo 16

The Real Estate Advertisement module That includes:

1. A form view summarizes important information for the property
2. With three tabs,  The first tab contains information describing the property: bedrooms, living area, garage, gardenâ€¦
   The second tab lists the offers for the property and third tab with information of Salesman and buyer
3. Added field in the res.users to display the list of properties linked to a salesperson directly in the Settings / Users & Companies / Users form view

You need to change odoo.conf file, especially addons_path argument in order to the Odoo server will work properly.
